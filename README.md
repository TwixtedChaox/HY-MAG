# HY-MAG Fusion Drive System â€“ Full Concept Archive

Welcome to the official export package of the HY-MAG Fusion Drive System â€” a fully modular, hydrogen-electric hybrid engine platform designed for next-generation vehicles.

This archive includes everything needed to understand, evaluate, and develop the HY-MAG engine across multiple platforms (Claude, Gemini, Veo3). Each step has been written in plain language for clarity.

## ðŸ”§ FOLDER STRUCTURE

- `docs/`: Project overviews, cost breakdowns, use case examples, AI design process
- `cad/`: Mechanical parts in .STEP and .SVG formats for 3D design or schematics
- `control/`: Engine control logic, diagrams, and pseudocode for AI or developers
- `ai/`: Prompt templates, AI roles, and automation logic for development tasks
- `assets/`: Visual mockups, diagrams, and logo/icon references

## ðŸ’¡ WHO IS THIS FOR?

- **Investors**: Understand the market potential and proof of concept.
- **Engineers**: Begin prototyping or simulation.
- **AI Developers**: Use prebuilt prompts and logic to contribute.
- **Designers**: Generate content, interfaces, or videos of the system.

## ðŸ§  HOW TO USE THIS ARCHIVE

1. Start by reading `docs/project_overview.md`.
2. Explore each folder in order. Files are labeled clearly by function.
3. Use the AI prompt templates in `/ai/` to automate further development.
4. Open CAD files in FreeCAD, Fusion360, or Onshape to explore engine layout.
5. Use visual files from `/assets/` to pitch or present the system to non-engineers.

You're looking at the early files of a power system designed to change how clean energy moves.
